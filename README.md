# Blasti Frontend

This repository contains the front-end and database design components of **Blasti**, a platform to simplify appointment scheduling across various services, including medical appointments, salon bookings, and restaurant reservations. Developed as part of a team project with **Coding Dojo Africa**, Blasti's goal is to create a user-friendly experience for booking and managing appointments.

## Project Overview

As the **Scrum Master** and **Front-End Developer** for Blasti, I led the team’s development process and contributed to the project's structure. My primary responsibilities included:

- **Front-End Development**: Designing and implementing the entire front-end of the application.
- **Database Design**: Creating the database schema for managing users, appointments, and services.
- **Wireframes and UI Design**: Crafting the initial wireframes and user interface layouts to guide the project’s development.

The front-end is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript,** and **Bootstrap**, providing a responsive, accessible UI for users to make and manage appointments.

## Features

- **Complete Front-End Interface**: Designed and implemented all front-end pages, including appointment booking, category browsing, user profile, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Database Schema**: Designed the initial database schema for managing appointments and users.
- **Collaborative Project Management**: Facilitated teamwork as the Scrum Master, including conducting team meetings, assigning tasks, and managing the project timeline.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- **Database**: MySQL (schema designed using MySQL Workbench)
- **Design Tools**:
  - Figma (for wireframes)
  - Adobe XD and Illustrator (for visual elements)
- **Version Control**: GitHub (branching, pull requests)

## Folder Structure

- `controllers/`: Contains Python files for managing backend logic (provided by backend developers).
- `models/`: Holds database models for user data.
- `static/assets/`: Contains all CSS files for styling, organized by functionality.
  - `mainUser.css`: User-specific styles.
  - `service.css`: Styles for the service-related pages.
  - `style.css`: General styling across the application.
- `templates/`: Holds all HTML templates.
  - `index.html`: Home page for the application.
  - `addAppointment.html`: Page for adding appointments.
  - `mainPage.html`: Main user dashboard after login.
  - Additional templates for category pages, login/register, profile, etc.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Frontend**: Access the front-end by opening `index.html` or using a local server to view the complete UI.
2. **Navigate Through Pages**: Test the various pages like appointment booking, user login, profile, etc., to explore the full user flow.

## Database Design

The database schema (included in the `MyAppointments.erd.mwb` file) was designed to manage users, appointments, and service categories. You can view or edit it using **MySQL Workbench**.
